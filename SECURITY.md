# Security Policy

`unitedstates` is security-sensitive API and public-data infrastructure. Treat source
policy, request construction, credentials, redirects, parsing, decompression,
pagination, caching, provenance, rate limits, CI, releases, and dependency
changes as high risk until reviewed and tested.

## Current Security Scope

Version `0.1.0` is a repository foundation. It contains no concrete network or
TLS client and no production-ready source integration. A report that an
unimplemented feature is absent is not a vulnerability; an unsafe API,
credential leak, policy bypass, parser flaw, or supply-chain weakness is.

## Routine Checks

Run these regularly and before releases:

```bash
scripts/checks.sh
scripts/check_latest_tools.sh
scripts/release_0_1_gate.sh
cargo deny check
cargo audit
```

GitHub Actions run CI. GitHub CodeQL default setup must be enabled in repository
security settings. Do not add an advanced CodeQL workflow while default setup
is active. See [GitHub security settings](docs/github-security-settings.md).

## Release Gate

Every release uses one simple loop:

1. Codex may commit freely while implementing and testing the version.
2. When implementation and local verification finish, Codex commits the
   completed `AWAITING PENTEST` state and asks the maintainer to pentest that
   exact `HEAD`.
3. The maintainer reports findings, or reports that no findings were found.
4. Codex keeps `security/pentest/vX.Y.Z.md` current, fixes findings, and reruns
   the local gates until the report can say `Status: PASS`.
5. Implementation, fixes, release metadata, and the pentest report are committed
   together.
6. Codex waits for the maintainer to report the GitHub Actions and CodeQL
   default-setup result.
7. If the maintainer reports a GitHub issue, Codex fixes it, updates the same
   pentest report, commits again, and waits for the next maintainer report.
8. If the maintainer reports that GitHub is green, Codex still waits until the
   maintainer explicitly requests the tag.

Development and remediation commits are allowed whenever useful. The
pentest-target commit and later `PASS`/remediation commits must keep the
version report current. No tag is created or pushed without the maintainer's
explicit request. See
[the release plan](docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md).

## Dependency Policy

Project crates currently use no third-party dependencies. `deny.toml` denies
unknown registries, unknown Git sources, wildcard versions, duplicate versions,
and known advisories. A future exception requires a dedicated admission
release, current-version verification, license and maintenance review,
feature/`std` review, source inspection, tests, security documentation, and a
pentest of the affected boundary.

Tooling dependencies are pinned in CI and checked for freshness before release.

## Reporting

Do not publish exploitable security details in an issue. Use GitHub private
security advisories for `valkyoth/unitedstates`, or contact the repository maintainer
privately if that channel is unavailable.
